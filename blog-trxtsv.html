  <title>Getting my data back from Quicken</title>

<p>The Quicken Interchange Format (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicken_Interchange_Format">QIF</a>) is notoriously inadequate for
clean import/export. The <a href="https://quicken.custhelp.com/cgi-bin/quicken.cfg/php/enduser/std_adp.php?p_faqid=774&amp;p_created=1129160880&amp;p_sid=Lr_SmM1i&amp;p_lva=&amp;p_sp=cF9zcmNoPTEmcF9zb3J0X2J5PSZwX2dyaWRzb3J0PSZwX3Jvd19jbnQ9OSZwX3Byb2RzPTk1LDExNCZwX2NhdHM9JnBfcHY9Mi4xMTQmcF9jdj0mcF9wYWdlPTEmcF9zZWFyY2hfdGV4dD1jb252ZXJ0IHdpbmRvd3M*&amp;p_li=&amp;p_topview=1#Import">instructions</a> for migrating <a href="http://quicken.intuit.com/">Quicken</a> data
across platforms say:</p>

<ol>
  <li>From the old platform, dump it out as QIF</li>
  <li>On the new platform, read in the QIF data</li>
  <li>After importing the file, verify that account balances in your
     new Quicken for Mac 2004 data file are the same as those in
     Quicken for Windows. If they don't match, look for duplicate or
     missing transactions.</li>
</ol>
<p>I have not migrated my data from Windows98 to OS X because of this
mess.  I use win4lin on my debian linux box as life-support for
Quicken 2001.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Quicken supports printing any report to a tab-separated
file, and I found that an exhaustive transaction report represents
transfers unambiguously. Since October 2000, when my testing showed
that I could re-create various balances and reports from these
tab-separated reports, I have been maintaining a CVS history of
my exported Quicken data, splitting it every few years:</p>

<pre>
   $ wc *qtrx.txt
    4785   38141  276520 1990-1996qtrx.txt
    6193   61973  432107 1997-1999qtrx.txt
    4307   46419  335592 2000qtrx.txt
    5063   54562  396610 2002qtrx.txt
    5748   59941  437710 2004qtrx.txt
   26096  261036 1878539 total
</pre>

<p>I switched from CVS to <a
href="http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/">mercurial</a> a few months
ago, carrying the history over. I seem to have 189 commits/changesets,
of which 154 are on the qtrx files (others are on the makefile and
related scripts). So that's about one commit every two weeks.</p>
